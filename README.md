## General Information
- Event dispatcher usage example in multiplayer project under mirror framework
Provided clasess:
1)EventDispactcher - It allows to centralize event management, add listeners, trigger events and send customizable structures as event parameters. 
Some examples of these events and the messages (structs) that are sent can be found in the "Events" folder.
2)ServiceManager - It is a design pattern to access instances of the most common managers or services. 
In this case, this code example is shown since it is a class that is often required by the rest of the cases that are shown in this repository.
3)UIManager- It is a manager that controls most of our project and shows several examples of use of the EventDispatcher related to the connection of players and the events of establishing calls between them.
